## iNATTY Oracle

## How It Works

There's an iNatty relay (python script), that is called periodically with user names to process. This builds a database of nature observations, with meta data to be used in minting NFTs.

The Judging Criteria

When the challenge is closed for submissions, the RDX Works Scrypto team will review the submissions and decide on the three winners based on these criteria:

- Quality and asset-orientedness of your code. Refer to our design patterns page.
- Breadth of functionality.
- Creativity of the concept.
- Quality of the documentation and comments in the code for others who wish to use the blueprint.
- Usage of the frontend javascript SDK or the transaction manifest to allow us to test your components using a web interface. The look of the frontend will not influence the judging.
